<h2>About this Site</h2>
<p>
	This site was created using <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" target="_blank"
		>SvelteKit</a
	>. The desire was to reduce server costs to a minimum and maximize efficiency of
	load time. To do this I:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Favored embedded SVGs over image files</li>
	<li>Favored CSS over JS</li>
	<li>Opted for client-side rendering</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This site was made using Svelte structured for client-side only. The reason for
	using Svelte was because of its simplicity to get started, scalability, and
	small size. I also particularly am a fan of SvelteKit enforcing <a
		href="https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/accessibility">accessibility</a
	> rules by default.
</p>
<p>
	I chose to not include an project dependencies outside of the standard
	SvelteKit. This is to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in 3rd-party packages,
	as well as reduce the risk of the site breaking during version upgrades. Overall
	this should limit the long-term maintenance effort required.
</p>
<p>While I am a huge fan of various design systems,</p>
<ul>
	Here are some of my favorites design systems if you need one
	<li><a href="https://primedesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">Prime 6</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://m3.material.io/" target="_blank">Material 3</a></li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://atlassian.design/" target="_blank">Atlassian Design</a>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	What that means though, is that for better or worse, what you see here was
	developed all on my own.
